# Artifact rejection. 

This script performs PSG-oriented artifact rejection. Specifically, it takes two files containing EEG- and ECG-based artifacts, and applies them to the hypnography file that contains the sleep staging. It is important that the time epochs from the hypno file, and those of the artifact files are in the same 'scale'!
